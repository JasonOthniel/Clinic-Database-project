# Clinic-Database-project

This is from a school project from my summer 2022.
This is a group project with two other classmates.
The goal is to make a small database of an imaginary company and make an application to access the database. 
The goal is to apply the knowledge of SQL.
The application was made with Java programming language using VS code.
The pictures uploaded are rough diagrams for the database, it does not reflect the final database, please rea.

# What is in the database?
Some points are further split into 2 tables. To see more details refer to .sql file(the query that is run in the application is not there.
- patient's data(Name, birth date phone number, diagnosis, emergency contact, insurance provider)
- employee's data(Name, SSN, birth date, salary, occupation
- doctor's schedule(doctor's ID and time slot
- doctor's specialization(doctor's ID and specialization)
- medicine data sold in the clinic's pharmacy(name, price, information whether a medicine needs a prescription or not, number of available supply.
- transactions(billing ID, patients ID being billed, date, amount payed, cashier ID
- medicine supplier and medicine orders
The initial data injected to the database are also in the same file.

# What can the application do?

# How to connect the JDBC?


# Where is the query used in the application?
You can check on the App.java, that is where all the application code is.
