# Clinic-Database-project

This is from a school project from my summer 2022.
This is a group project with two other classmates.
The goal is to make a small database of an imaginary company and make an application to access the database. 
The goal is to apply the knowledge of SQL.
The application was made with Java.

# What is in the database?
Employee data, patients data, doctor's schedule, drugs that are sold in a pharmacy, drug supplier.

to see more details refer to .sql file.
The initial data injected to the database are also in the same file.

#

# What can the program do?

# Where is the query used in the application?
You can check on the App.java, that is where all the application code is.
