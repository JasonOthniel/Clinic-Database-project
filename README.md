# Clinic-Database-project

This is from a school project from my summer 2022.
This is a group project with two other classmates.
The goal is to make a small database of an imaginary company and make an application to access the database. 
The goal is to apply the knowledge of SQL.
The application was made with Java programming language using VS code.

# What is in the database?
Some points are further split into 2 tables.
- patient's data(Name, birth date phone number, diagnosis, emergency contact, insurance provider)
- employee's data(Name, SSN, birth date, salary, occupation
- doctor's schedule(doctor's ID and time slot
- doctor's specialization(doctor's ID and specialization)
- medicine data sold in the clinic's pharmacy(name, price, information whether a medicine needs a prescription or not, number of available supply.
- transactions(billing ID, patients ID being billed, date, amount payed, cashier ID
- medicine supplier and medicine orders
to see more details refer to .sql file.
The initial data injected to the database are also in the same file.

# How to connect the JDBC?

# What can the application do?

# Where is the query used in the application?
You can check on the App.java, that is where all the application code is.
